<li><e>ALL MATTER -From a paper in a book is printedon to the air that we breathe ismade up of tiny particles called ATOMS.Each atom has a positively charged center called a NUCLEUS.Nuclei contain positively charged particles called PROTONS and uncharged(neutral)particles called neutrons.
Mutch smaller , negatively charged particles and uncharged(neutral)particles called nuetrons.Much smaller , negatively charged particles called electrons electrons whizz around the nuclei at high speed.</e>

In general , the number of electrons in an object exactly matches the number of protons.The negative charges of the electrons balance the positive charges of the electrons baance the possitive charges of the protons and the object is neutral.An object that has fewer electrons than protons has a possitive charge and will attract electrons.A negatively charged object will readily pass its surplus electrons to a positively chqrged object.</li></ul></small>

<li><small>Static electricity has intrigued people for so many centuries.Around 2,500 years ago , the Greek philosopher <big>Thales</big> (625-547<small><small>BC</small></small>)observed that rubbing a silk cloth over a piece of fossilized tree sap, called amber , cause the cloth, and other lightwight objects such as feathers, to be attraced to the amber.It is now known that this attraction occurs because rubbing drags electrons from the surface of the amber.The negatively charged amber attracts objects as it tries to thos objects.</small>
